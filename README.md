# LIT CTF 2021 - Aftermath

- Team Name: noobzUnited
- Team place: 36 / 904
- Challenge solved: 30/51 

## Thoughts and Experiences

- This CTF we did really really well, a lot better than the other ones, we also managed to recruit one more team member

- Despite that we feel like we could have done better, and also got really close to solving a lot of the remaining challenges

- Again wasn't able to solve... what a shame 

- Overall we did really well and i also managed to somewhat get better at code analysis... for python
