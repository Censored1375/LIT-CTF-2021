# Filter Collector - Crypto

- It is clear that we cannot recover enough information to recover the entire flag in one connection, so we must figure out a way to recover a portion of the flag. Given that we are able to input a modulus for all computations to be computed in, the obvious decision is to use CRT to recover the flag.

- However, we first have to figure out how to recover the flag, which has been partitioned; to do this, we must somehow find the sum of every 7th integer in the polynomial. 

- Say that we have 7 elements of the multiplicative group of integers; we know that for any prime modulus, the group is cyclic. We also know that the flag partitions in the polynomial are in terms `x^m`, where m is any multiple of 7.

- Thus, we search for a cyclic group of order 7 in the finite field of any arbitrary modulus, as long as it is prime (this is a requirement for CRT). We input into the connection all 6 non-one elements of the group, and collect the output. Define the elements `G_i` as `b^i` for all positive integral i less than 7. 

- Let us define the polynomial to be expressed as `a_i * x^i` for all positive integral i less than 200. Then, the 6 outputs are:
```
a_0 + a_1 * G_1 + a_2 * G_2 + a_3 * G_3 + a_4 + G_4 + a_5 * G_5 + a_6 * G_6 ...
a_0 + a_1 * G_2 + a_2 * G_3 + a_3 * G_4 + a_4 + G_5 + a_5 * G_6 + a_6 * G_1 ...
a_0 + a_1 * G_3+ a_2 * G_4 + a_3 * G_5 + a_4 + G_6 + a_5 * G_1 + a_6 * G_2 ...
a_0 + a_1 * G_4 + a_2 * G_5 + a_3 * G_6 + a_4 + G_1 + a_5 * G_2 + a_6 * G_3 ...
a_0 + a_1 * G_5 + a_2 * G_6 + a_3 * G_1 + a_4 + G_2 + a_5 * G_3 + a_6 * G_4 ... 
a_0 + a_1 * G_6 + a_2 * G_1 + a_3 * G_2 + a_4 + G_3 + a_5 * G_4 + a_6 * G_5 ...
= 6 * a_0 + a_1 * Σ G_(1-6) + a_2 * Σ G_(1-6) + a_3* Σ G_(1-6) + a_4* Σ G_(1-6) + a_5 * Σ G_(1-6) + a_6 * Σ G_(1-6) ...
```
We then input 1 into the program; let this output be c. `6c = 6 * a_0 + 6 * a_1 + 6 * a_2 + 6 * a_3 + 6 * a_4 + 6 * a_5 + 6 * a_6 ... . `Subtractng 6c from the sum of the previous 6 outputs, we arrive at:

`a_1 * Σ G_(1-6)-6 + a_2 * Σ G_(1-6)-6 + a_3* Σ G_(1-6)-6 + a_4* Σ G_(1-6)-6 + a_5 * Σ G_(1-6)-6 + a_6 * Σ G_(1-6)-6 ...`

We know each element of G, and we can simply compute `Σ G_(1-6)-6`.  We can simply divide by multiplying this sum by `inverse_mod(Σ G_(1-6)-6, m)` to recover `a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+a_5+a_6`. Computing this from c, we are able to recover the sum of every 7th partition (the flag), modulo a chosen modulus.

To recover the flag, we need to repeat this process enough times. Doing this, we are left with a list of residues and moduli. Using CRT, we are left with the flag.

Here's my full solve script:

```python
import sympy
from sympy.ntheory.modular import crt
from pwn import *
used = []
list_primes = []
for j in range(10000,12000): # find cyclic groups of order 7
    if sympy.isprime(j): 
        for i in range(2,j):
            if pow(i,7,j)==1 and j not in used:
                l2 = []
                sum = 0
                for p in range(1,7):
                    l2.append(pow(i,p,j))
                list_primes.append((l2,j))
                used.append(j)
residues = []
modulos = []
for prime in list_primes:
    r = remote("filtercollector.litctf.live",1337)
    r.recvuntil("favorite mod: ")
    r.sendline(str(prime[1]))
    res = 0
    def get_number(inp):
        r.recvuntil("Input the a number: ")
        r.sendline(str(inp))
        r.recvuntil("filter is ")
        return(int(r.recvline().strip()))
    for i in prime[0]:
        res+=get_number(i)
    sum = get_number(1)
    res-=(sum*6)
    d = pow(prime[1]-7,-1,prime[1]) #do the computation to recover sum of every 7th partition
    b = (res*d)%prime[1]
    r = (sum-b)%prime[1]
    residues.append(r)
    modulos.append(prime[1])
print(bytes.fromhex(hex(crt(modulos,residues)[0])[2:]).decode()) #CRT and dec -> ascii
```
